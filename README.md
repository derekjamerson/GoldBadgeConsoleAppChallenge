CHALLENGE 1: CAFE
Komodo Cafe
Komodo cafe is getting a new menu. The manager wants to be able to create new menu items, delete menu items, and receive a list of all items on the cafe's menu. She needs a console app.

 

The Menu Items:
A meal number, so customers can say "I'll have the #5"
A meal name
A description
A list of ingredients,
A price
 

Your Task:
Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test your constructors or objects, just your methods)
Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.
 

Notes:
We don't need to be able to update items right now.

CHALLENGE 4: COMPANY OUTINGS
Komodo Outings
Komodo accountants need a list of all outings, the cost of all outings combined, and the cost of all types of outings combined.

Here are the parts of an outing:
Event Type:   Golf, Bowling, Amusement Park, Concert
Number of people that attended
Date
Total cost per person for the event
Total cost for the event
 

Here's what they'd like:
Display a list of all outings.
Add individual outings to a list(don't need to worry about delete yet)
Calculations:
They'd like to see a display for the combined cost for all outings.
They'd like to see a display of outing costs by type.
For example, all bowling outings for the year were $2000.00. All Concert outings cost $5000.00.
 

Be sure to Unit Test your Repository methods.

CHALLENGE 5: GREETING
Email Problem
Komodo Insurance is trying to send an email to everyone in the world. They want to share some of their great deals with current, past, and potential customers.

 

For their current customers, they want to send an appreciation email, something that says this:
"Thank you for your work with us. We appreciate your loyalty. Here's a coupon."

 

For past customers, they want to send a note that says something like this:
"It's been a long time since we've heard from you, we want you back".

 

For potential customers who have never worked with Komodo, they want to send an email that simply states what deals Komodo is currently offering. It would be something like this:
"We currently have the lowest rates on Helicopter Insurance!"

 

Along with defining the proper class for a customer, your task will be to make an application that allows administrators to do CRUD methods: create, read, update, and delete details about individual customers.

List View:
In addition to CRUD options, an administrator needs to show all customers in alphabetical order in a list.

Be sure to Unit Test your Repository methods.

Out of scope:
Actually sending an email. We are just creating the string for the email.
